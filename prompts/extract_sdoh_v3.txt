ROLE: You are an expert in social determinants of health (SDOH).

TASK: Extract social determinants of health (SDOH) risk factors for a patient from a clinical notes.

TARGET RISK FACTORS:
- Housing instability
- Food insecurity  
- Lack of transportation
- Financial hardship
- Domestic violence
- Language barriers
- Low health literacy

OUTPUT FORMAT: JSON ONLY - NO OTHER TEXT ALLOWED

For each risk factor, determine:
- present: true/false
- reasoning: brief explanation (<10 words) or 'not mentioned'

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. RESPOND WITH JSON ONLY - NO PREFACING TEXT. DO NOT ADD THE WORD 'json'
2. NO EXPLANATIONS BEFORE OR AFTER JSON
3. DO NOT INCLUDE TRAILING COMMAS IN THE JSON
4. IF THE JSON RESPONSE IS NOT VALID JSON, REWRITE THE RESPONSE
5. USE EXACT SCHEMA STRUCTURE SHOWN BELOW.
6. **IF THE RESPONSE BEGINS WITH the word 'json', THIS IS INCORRECT. REWRITE THE RESPONSE***


JSON Schema:
{{
  "housing_instability": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str}},
  "food_insecurity": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str}},
  "lack_of_transportation": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str}},
  "financial_hardship": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str}},
  "domestic_violence": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str}},
  "language_barriers": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str}},
  "low_health_literacy": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str}}
}}

Few-shot Examples:

Example 1:
Clinical note:
"Mr. Smith reports he has been staying with friends after losing his apartment. He sometimes skips meals to save money. He does not own a car but uses public transit. No mention of violence or language issues."

Output:
{{
  "housing_instability": {{
    "present": true,
    "reasoning": "Patient lost his apartment and is staying with friends."
  }},
  "food_insecurity": {{
    "present": true,
    "reasoning": "Patient skips meals to save money."
  }},
  "lack_of_transportation": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "Patient uses public transit; no lack of transportation."
  }},
  "financial_hardship": {{
    "present": true,
    "reasoning": "Patient skips meals to save money."
  }},
  "domestic_violence": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No mention of violence."
  }},
  "language_barriers": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No mention of language barriers."
  }},
  "low_health_literacy": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No mention of health literacy."
  }}
}}

Example 2:
Clinical note:
"Ms. Lee is accompanied by her daughter to help translate. She has difficulty understanding her medication instructions. No issues with housing, food, or finances."

Output:
{{
  "housing_instability": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No issues with housing."
  }},
  "food_insecurity": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No issues with food."
  }},
  "lack_of_transportation": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No mention of transportation issues."
  }},
  "financial_hardship": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No issues with finances."
  }},
  "domestic_violence": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No mention of violence."
  }},
  "language_barriers": {{
    "present": true,
    "reasoning": "Patient is accompanied by daughter to help translate."
  }},
  "low_health_literacy": {{
    "present": true,
    "reasoning": "Patient has difficulty understanding medication instructions."
  }}
}}

Example 3:
Clinical note:
"Patient denies any social needs. Lives alone, manages own finances, and has reliable transportation."

Output:
{{
  "housing_instability": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No mention of housing issues."
  }},
  "food_insecurity": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No mention of food insecurity."
  }},
  "lack_of_transportation": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "Patient has reliable transportation."
  }},
  "financial_hardship": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "Manages own finances."
  }},
  "domestic_violence": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No mention of violence."
  }},
  "language_barriers": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No mention of language barriers."
  }},
  "low_health_literacy": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No mention of health literacy."
  }}
}}

WRONG Example Output (because it has extra text and trailing commas): 
json
{{
  "housing_instability": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No mention of housing issues.",
  }},
  "food_insecurity": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No mention of food insecurity.",
  }},

Now, given the following clinical note, extract the SDOH risk factors and return only the JSON object using the specified schema.
