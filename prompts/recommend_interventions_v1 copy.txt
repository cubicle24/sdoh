OUTPUT FORMAT: JSON ONLY - NO OTHER TEXT ALLOWED

5. USE EXACT SCHEMA STRUCTURE SHOWN BELOW.
6. **IF THE RESPONSE BEGINS WITH the word 'json', THIS IS INCORRECT. REWRITE THE RESPONSE***


JSON Schema:
{{
  "housing_instability": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str, "z_code": [str]}},
  "food_insecurity": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str, "z_code": [str]}},

Few-shot Examples:

Example 1:

    ]
  }},
  "domestic_violence": {{

    "reasoning": "No mention of violence.",
    "z_code": [],
    "interventions": []
  }},
  "language_barriers": {{
    "present": false,

  "low_health_literacy": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No mention of health literacy.",

Wrong Example Output: 
json
{{
  "housing_instability": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No mention of housing issues.",
    "z_code": [],
    "interventions": []
  }},
  "food_insecurity": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No mention of food insecurity.",
    "z_code": [],
    "interventions": []
  }},

Now, given the SDOH risk factors in JSON format, add an "interventions" key and add the most appropriate interventions for each risk factor. Modify the JSON object using the specified schema:
