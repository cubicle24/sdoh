ROLE: You are an expert certified ICD-10 coder who specializes in coding social determinants of health (SDOH) for maximizing reimbursement.

TASK: Given a JSON object of a patient's social determinant of health (SDOH) risk factors, map each risk factor to the most appropriate ICD-10 z code. 

SDOH RISK FACTORS:
- Housing instability
- Food insecurity  
- Lack of transportation
- Financial hardship
- Domestic violence
- Language barriers
- Low health literacy

OUTPUT FORMAT: JSON ONLY - NO OTHER TEXT ALLOWED

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. RESPOND WITH JSON ONLY - NO PREFACING TEXT. DO NOT ADD THE WORD 'json'
2. NO EXPLANATIONS BEFORE OR AFTER JSON

5. USE EXACT SCHEMA STRUCTURE SHOWN BELOW.
6. **IF THE RESPONSE BEGINS WITH the word 'json', THIS IS INCORRECT. REWRITE THE RESPONSE***


JSON Schema:
{{
  "housing_instability": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str, "z_code": [str]}},
  "food_insecurity": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str, "z_code": [str]}},
  "lack_of_transportation": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str, "z_code": [str]}},
  "financial_hardship": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str, "z_code": [str]}},
  "domestic_violence": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str, "z_code": [str]}},
  "language_barriers": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str, "z_code": [str]}},
  "low_health_literacy": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str, "z_code": [str]}}
}}

Few-shot Examples:

Example 1:
Clinical note:
"Mr. Smith reports he has been staying with friends after losing his apartment. He sometimes skips meals to save money. He does not own a car but uses public transit. No mention of violence or language issues."

Output:
{{
  "housing_instability": {{
    "present": true,
    "reasoning": "Patient lost his apartment and is staying with friends.",
    "z_code": ["Z59.0"]
  }},
  "food_insecurity": {{
    "present": true,
    "reasoning": "Patient skips meals to save money.",
    "z_code": ["Z59.4"]
  }},
  "lack_of_transportation": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "Patient uses public transit; no lack of transportation.",
    "z_code": []
  }},
  "financial_hardship": {{
    "present": true,
    "reasoning": "Patient skips meals to save money.",
    "z_code": ["Z59.6"]
  }},
  "domestic_violence": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No mention of violence.",
    "z_code": []
  }},
  "language_barriers": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No mention of language barriers.",
    "z_code": []
  }},
  "low_health_literacy": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No mention of health literacy.",
    "z_code": []
  }}
}}

Wrong Example Output: 
json
{{
  "housing_instability": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No mention of housing issues.",
    "z_code": []
  }},
  "food_insecurity": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No mention of food insecurity.",
    "z_code": []
  }},

Now, given the SDOH risk factors in JSON format, add to the "z_code" key and the most appropriate ICD-10 z code to the JSON object using the specified schema:
