You are an expert in social determinants of health (SDOH). Given a clinical note, extract the following SDOH risk factors for the patient:

- Housing instability
- Food insecurity
- Lack of transportation
- Financial hardship
- Domestic violence
- Language barriers
- Low health literacy

For each risk factor, return:
- present: true if the risk factor is present, false otherwise
- reasoning: a brief explanation (less than 10 words) for your decision, citing evidence from the note or stating "not mentioned"
- z_code: a list of relevant ICD-10 Z codes (e.g., ["Z59.0"])

Instructions:
- IMPORTANT: Always return a JSON object with EXACTLY the same keys and structure as shown below. DO NOT include any text before/after the JSON
- If a risk factor is not mentioned, set "present" to false and "reasoning" to "not mentioned".
- Only use valid ICD-10 Z codes.
- Never include any text outside the JSON object.

JSON Schema:
{{
  "housing_instability": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str, "z_code": [str]}},
  "food_insecurity": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str, "z_code": [str]}},
  "lack_of_transportation": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str, "z_code": [str]}},
  "financial_hardship": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str, "z_code": [str]}},
  "domestic_violence": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str, "z_code": [str]}},
  "language_barriers": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str, "z_code": [str]}},
  "low_health_literacy": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str, "z_code": [str]}}
}}

Few-shot Examples:

Example 1:
Clinical note:
"Mr. Smith reports he has been staying with friends after losing his apartment. He sometimes skips meals to save money. He does not own a car but uses public transit. No mention of violence or language issues."

Output:
{{
  "housing_instability": {{
    "present": true,
    "reasoning": "Patient lost his apartment and is staying with friends.",
    "z_code": ["Z59.0"]
  }},
  "food_insecurity": {{
    "present": true,
    "reasoning": "Patient skips meals to save money.",
    "z_code": ["Z59.4"]
  }},
  "lack_of_transportation": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "Patient uses public transit; no lack of transportation.",
    "z_code": []
  }},
  "financial_hardship": {{
    "present": true,
    "reasoning": "Patient skips meals to save money.",
    "z_code": ["Z59.6"]
  }},

    "z_code": []
  }},
  "low_health_literacy": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No mention of health literacy.",
    "z_code": []
  }}
}}

Example 2:
Clinical note:
"Ms. Lee is accompanied by her daughter to help translate. She has difficulty understanding her medication instructions. No issues with housing, food, or finances."

Output:
{{
  "housing_instability": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No issues with housing.",
    "z_code": []
  }},
  "food_insecurity": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No issues with food.",
    "z_code": []
  }},
  "lack_of_transportation": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No mention of transportation issues.",
    "z_code": []
  }},
  "financial_hardship": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No issues with finances.",
    "z_code": []
  }},
  "domestic_violence": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No mention of violence.",
    "z_code": []
  }},
  "language_barriers": {{
    "present": true,
    "reasoning": "Patient is accompanied by daughter to help translate.",
    "z_code": ["Z55.8"]
  }},
  "low_health_literacy": {{
    "present": true,
    "reasoning": "Patient has difficulty understanding medication instructions.",
    "z_code": ["Z55.8"]
  }}
}}

Example 3:
Clinical note:
"Patient denies any social needs. Lives alone, manages own finances, and has reliable transportation."

Output:
{{
  "housing_instability": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No mention of housing issues.",
    "z_code": []
  }},
  "food_insecurity": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No mention of food insecurity.",
    "z_code": []
  }},
  "lack_of_transportation": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "Patient has reliable transportation.",
    "z_code": []
  }},
  "financial_hardship": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "Manages own finances.",
    "z_code": []
  }},
  "domestic_violence": {{

  "low_health_literacy": {{
    "present": false,
    "reasoning": "No mention of health literacy.",
    "z_code": []
  }}
}}
