TASK: Given a JSON object of a patient's social determinant of health (SDOH) risk factors and another JSON object of social services,
recommend the most appropriate interventions for only the SDOH risk factor(s) that are present. Output these as an "interventions" key: value pair.
If a JSON object of social services is not available, then recommend generalized, evidence-based interventions that you think would help the SDOH risk factors in the patient.

SDOH RISK FACTORS:
{sdoh_risk_factors}

SOCIAL SERVICES:
{social_services}

OUTPUT FORMAT: 
Your final response must be valid JSON following this exact schema, with no extra text nor the preface word 'json':
