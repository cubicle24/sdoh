TASK: Given a JSON object of a patient's social determinant of health (SDOH) risk factors and ICD-10 z codes, use the available tools to recommend the most appropriate interventions for only the SDOH risk factor(s) that are present.

WORKFLOW:
1. If you need the patient's location for local service recommendations, call get_patient_zipcode first
2. Use search_social_services to find relevant local services based on the zipcode
3. After gathering all necessary information from tools, provide your final response as JSON

SDOH RISK FACTORS:
- Housing instability
- Food insecurity  
- Lack of transportation
- Financial hardship
- Domestic violence
- Language barriers
- Low health literacy

AVAILABLE TOOLS:
1. search_social_services -- looks for local services for housing, food, financial assistance, etc. 
2. get_patient_zipcode -- gets the patient's zipcode to use when searching for local social services

IMPORTANT: After calling any tools and receiving their results, incorporate that information into your intervention recommendations and then provide your final response in the JSON format below.

OUTPUT FORMAT: 
Your final response must be valid JSON following this exact schema:

{{
  "housing_instability": {{present": bool, "reasoning": str, "z_code": [str],"interventions": [str]}},
  "food_insecurity": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str, "z_code": [str], "interventions": [str]}},
  "lack_of_transportation": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str, "z_code": [str],"interventions": [str]}},
  "financial_hardship": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str, "z_code": [str],"interventions": [str]}},
  "domestic_violence": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str, "z_code": [str],"interventions": [str]}},
  "language_barriers": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str, "z_code": [str], "interventions": [str]}},
  "low_health_literacy": {{"present": bool, "reasoning": str, "z_code": [str],"interventions": [str]}}
}}

Example with tool usage:
If housing_instability is present, you might:
1. Call get_patient_zipcode to get "98029"
2. Call search_social_services with zipcode 98029 and service type "housing"
3. Use the results to populate specific local housing resources in the interventions array
